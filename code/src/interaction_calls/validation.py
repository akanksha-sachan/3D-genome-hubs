# Code for validating the called edges (checking with pre-called data/other evaluation metrics)
# Loop validation: Nearby 1-d genomic distance for both anchors
# O/E validation: A/B score correlation/confusion matrix
# {not using these edges currently} TAD validation: insulation score correlation/confusion matrix
